## User Panel - Test Status

### Test Login:

1. Go to: **https://userpanel-lac.vercel.app/login**
2. Try logging in with:
   - Username: `user` or `admin`
   - Password: `user123` or `admin123`

### Expected Results:

✅ **If working:**
- Should redirect to dashboard
- Should show user data (may be $0.00 for new users)
- No "Invalid credentials" error

❌ **If not working:**
- Still shows "Invalid username or password"
- Check Railway deployment logs
- Verify users exist in Supabase

---

## Next Steps to Verify:

### 1. Check Railway Backend Logs

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your backend service
3. Click **Logs** tab
4. Look for:
   - "✅ Prisma client initialized"
   - Any error messages related to login

### 2. Verify Users in Supabase

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ddpjrwoyjphumeenabyb
2. Click **Table Editor** → `users` table
3. Check if `admin` and `user` exist
4. Verify `password` field has hash starting with `$2b$10$...`

### 3. Test API Directly

```bash
# Test login endpoint
curl -X POST https://considerate-adventure-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user","password":"user123"}'
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "user": {...},
    "token": "..."
  }
}
```

## What We Fixed:

1. ✅ **Backend Auth Route** - Now supports Prisma
2. ✅ **User Creation SQL** - Fixed column mismatch
3. ✅ **Dashboard API** - Updated to use Prisma
4. ✅ **Admin Panel** - Already working with real data

---

## If User Panel Login Still Fails:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Railway deployment to complete
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check Railway logs** for Prisma errors
4. **Verify DATABASE_URL** in Railway environment variables
5. **Check if USE_PRISMA=true** in Railway environment variables
