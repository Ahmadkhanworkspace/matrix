## 📋 How to Add New Cron Jobs

See `backend/CRON_JOBS_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

Quick steps:
1. Add your task function to `CronService.js`
2. Register it in `initialize()` method with a cron schedule
3. (Optional) Add manual trigger endpoint for testing

Example:
```javascript
// In CronService.js
async myNewTask() {
  // Your logic here
}

// In initialize()
this.scheduleJob('my-new-job', '0 * * * *', async () => {
  await this.myNewTask();
});
```
